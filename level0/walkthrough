./level0 file has owner level1 and we see 's' in file permissions, 's' enables other users to inherit the effective GID of file group owner,
so we can use that to run shell script from file owner, the program starts the /bin/sh (row 145) command by the level1 only if passed argument is equal to 423 (row 30),
  so we just need to run ./level0 423, next the command `whoami` output is level1, so we can do next command:
`cat /home/user/level1/.pass` and catch the flag
