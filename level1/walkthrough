/level1 file has owner level2 and we see 's' in file permissions, 's' enables other users to inherit the effective GID of file group owner,
so we can use that to run shell script from file owner. From disassembly we see a static memory allocation, guess it is for string for gets() call, after several tries
i found out that the program exits with error, because input string length is more that the program was allocated, and this long string overwrites the program stack.
We can use a classic buffer overflow attack which allows to run "/bin/bash" command with file owner permissions.
